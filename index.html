        Prepare Pickling Solution. Start by making the pickling solution, here's
        the basic breakdown:
      </li>

      <br />
      <ul>
        <li>1L - Water</li>
        <li>42g - Sodium hydroxide(NaOH) (lye)</li>
        <li>72g - Sodium chloride(NaCl) (salt)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        On a scale weigh out the lye and salt. Over low heat dissolve the salt
        and lye completely in water. Bring the solution to a boil and allow it
        to cool down before use. <br />
        Place raw eggs into glass jar and pour the cooled pickling solution over
        eggs. Ensure all eggs are completely submerged.
      </p>
      <br />
      <!-- Step 3-->
      <li>
        Store. I wrote the date of submerging these eggs on my label, as well as
        the expected dates for encasing in clay, and eventual consumption. Label
        jar and store in a safe place, like the corner of your desk, so all your
        coworkers can gawk in disgust (or silent admiration). I also added a
        warning so my coworkers wouldn't mess with the jar while the eggs were
        pickling.
        <br />
        Leave eggs at 15-20°C (60-70°F) for about 10 days. Keep an eye on them
        to ensure they don't pop up above the solution and stay submerged.

      <!-- Step 4-->
      <li>
        Remove the Brine. After about 10 days it's time to remove the eggs.
        Carefully pour out brine and pick out eggs, rinse with water then towel
        dry. The shells should still be hard.
        <br />
        You should be able to see some discolouration through the shells.

      <br />
      <!-- Step 5-->
      <li>
        Encase. Traditionally century eggs were rolled in mud then wrapped in
        rice husks and buried for a few more weeks. In this modern version I
        simply wrapped the eggs in several layers of clear plastic wrap then
        encased in modeling clay. This inhibits oxygen from reaching the eggs
        while they cure.
        <br />
        Be careful when encasing in clay as not to break the eggs. After
        wrapping I put all the eggs into a resealable bag and left for another 2
        weeks.
      </li>

      <br />
      <br />
      <!-- Step 6-->
      <li>
        Crack open. After about a month from the when the eggs were first put
        into the brine solution it's time to open them up. Carefully remove the
        clay encasement and the plastic wrap, then tap the egg to break the
        shell and gently peel away. The eggs should be completely transformed!
        <br />
        The whites of the eggs will now be a jelly-like translucent amber colour
        and the yolks a very dark green and with a texture much like a hard
        boiled egg. Take a look at picture 2 in this step to see the different
        consistency between the yolk and white in my egg-xperiment.

      <!-- Step 7-->
      <li>
        Serve! Century eggs are typically served mashed up in soupy rice. I made
        a steamy bowl and served it to my friends.
        <br />
        The taste was...interesting. The appearance is deceiving and almost put
        me off eating it altogether, but once I ate some it wasn't that bad. It
        tasted kind of like a hard boiled egg, only with a more complex flavour
        and a slightly mineral/metallic taste. I'm happy I tried this and think
        I would probably eat it again. You know, sometime later (much, much
        later).
